Since Google Code Hosting turned off the ability to add new downloads with something resembling a convenient interface, and these are really small, they're all available in the Downloads source directory: http://latex-makefile.googlecode.com/hg/Downloads/.

Note that Version 2.2.1-alpha is in pretty good shape, so it's recommended to use that one.
